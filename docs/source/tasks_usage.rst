Creating and using tasks
========================

TODO: I've written SO MUCH already and need to get this into production. This week.

I'll come back and explain this, I promise.

IN THE MEANTIME:

Look at management commands available (both in django gcp and the example app), and look at the `full example implementation here <https://github.com/octue/django-gcp/tree/main/tests/server>`_ to pick up how to define and use tasks :)

If you need to use this library and can't figure it out, get in touch by raising an issue on GitHub and we'll help you configure your app (and write the docs at the same time).

Version History
===============

We used to recommend people create version histories. But we now do it automatically using
our `conventional commits tools <https://github/octue/conventional-commits>`_
for completely automating code versions, release numbering and release history.

So for a full version history, check our `releases page <https://github/octue/django-gcp/releases>`_.
